Algorithm ShortList:
1. Linear Regression -  Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. 
The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable.
2. Logistic Regression - Logistic regression estimates the probability of an event occurring, such as voted or didnâ€™t vote, based on a given dataset of independent variables. 
Since the outcome is a probability, the dependent variable is bounded between 0 and 1.
